        "\n",
        "1. **Input to the Generator**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * **Vanilla GAN**: The generator takes only a noise vector as input to produce an image.\n",
        "   * **Conditional GAN (cGAN)**: The generator takes both a noise vector and additional information (e.g., class labels or conditional data) as input to generate images conditioned on that information.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Input to the Discriminator**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * **Vanilla GAN**: The discriminator evaluates the realism of the generated image without any context.\n",
        "   * **Conditional GAN**: The discriminator evaluates the realism of the generated image *in the context of the provided conditional information*.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Output Control**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * **Vanilla GAN**: No control over the output. The generator produces random samples from the learned distribution.\n",
        "   * **Conditional GAN**: Provides control over the type of output, making it suitable for tasks where specific attributes need to be enforced.\n",

        "  * Conditioning is crucial when generating images from textual descriptions. For example, in e-commerce, generating product images based on textual specifications (\"a red shirt with white stripes\") requires a conditional GAN.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Distinguish between real images and generated (fake) images.\n",

        "  * **Style transfer**: Applying a specific artistic style to an image while retaining its content.\n",
